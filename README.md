Create a Java class that holds a collection of non-intersecting rectangles in 2D space. Write a method that accepts a list of points that need to be matched to the rectangles. A coordinate will match a rectangle if it's inside the area of rectangle.

IMPORTANT!  Code needs to be written in the most optimal way for performance and memory utilization. Code style is not important.

Assumptions:
1. Class can hold millions of rectangles â€“ should fit into a single machine memory
2. Rectangles are similar in size and not intersecting
3. Millions of coordinates can be passed into the method
4. The method can be called multiple times to match the rectangles to a different collection of coordinates.
5. A coordinate may not match any rectangle.
